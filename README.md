# docker-elk
A Docker Compose repository to create ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash and Kibana) containers compatible with my Logback configuration used on [Spring Cloud Sleuth](https://github.com/MarceloLeite2604/tutorials/tree/master/spring/cloud/spring-cloud-sleuth) learning project.

To use it just execute `docker-compose up` on root directory.

Thanks to [Anthony Lapenna](https://github.com/deviantony) for providing such elucidative examples about how to configure Docker containers on his [docker-elk repository](https://github.com/deviantony/docker-elk).
